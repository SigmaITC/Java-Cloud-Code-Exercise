## **Start of the journey**

All John ever wanted to be is a secret agent.
He’s been enhancing his skills in all sorts of weird stuff that he thinks a secret agent need.
These weeks he’s been practicing on how to read coded text.
He starts with reverse reading skills, but he needs your help!
To enhance it he needs help getting text in the reversed.

#### Your mission, if you choose to accept it.

Write a program to help John get text reversed. You need to have a text as an input and reverse the text completely.
Ex. “My name is John” to “nhoJ si eman yM”.

John also needs to be able to read your code and he doesn’t know what loops are.
So, you need to write this code without any loops.
